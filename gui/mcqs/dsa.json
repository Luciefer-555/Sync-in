      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Accessing an element in an array by its index is a constant time operation O(1) because the memory address can be calculated directly using the base address and the index.",

      "explanation": "A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle, meaning the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed.",
